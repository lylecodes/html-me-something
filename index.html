            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My powerlifting journey began in early 2017,
            upon competing in my first powerlifting meet. However, for many of
            the years leading up to that point, I was always involved in some
            sort of fitness related activity. Prior to powerlifting, I focused
            mainly on bodybuilding style training which involved staying in the
            higher repetition range (6-15) and having a high amount of exercise
            variation (to ensure a well-rounded physique).
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first exposure to powerlifting
            happened when I came across a YouTube video of a couple guys lifting
            some serious weight. I instantly became intrigued by this and
            started to research powerlifting training. Powerlifters have one
            goal; to get as strong as possible for a 1 repetition maximum in the
            squat, bench press, and deadlift. In competition, the winner in each
            weight class is determined by who has the highest total (squat +
            bench + deadlift). Therefore, much of their training is spent in the
            lower rep range (1-6) with an exercise selection focused on helping
            the competition lifts, as this is more specific to what is seen in
            competition. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is an
            individual sport, many powerlifters are a part of a team for
            support, to share ideas related to training theory, and to make
            friends. Every powerlifting competition I've been to, I've
            experienced and unparalleled amount of friendliness and camaraderie.
            It is clear that the competitor's main goal is to simply do better
            than they did last time, regardless of the results of the
            competition.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started doing Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)
            when I was 11, and continued to do so on and off until I joined the
            Army about 7 years later. BJJ is a submission-grappling based
            fighting sport that was brought to the states from Brazil in the
            1970s, via the Gracie family. The novelty of BJJ is that it's
            techniques are focused on using leverage to overcome bigger or
            stronger opponents. This was first realized by the world in 1993
            during the first ever UFC tournament, involving Royce Gracie of the
            Gracie family.
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royce successfully won the tournament
            by submitting all three of his opponents in the first round. Since
            seeing BJJ dominating every other martial art, mixed martial arts
            practitioners have placed a large emphasis on having a strong BJJ
            foundation. Doing BJJ gave me a lot of confidence early on in life
            as well as something I can be proud of. This was something I
            desperately needed at that point, because my early childhood wasn't
            the best. Also, knowing that I have the skills to defend myself and
            the ability to teach others was invaluable. This experience came in
            handy later on in life when I was given the opportunity to be a
            combatives instructor in the Army for some time.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading equities (stocks) is something that
            is relatively new to me. I started about a year and a half ago and
            that first year was spent just learning how the market works and
            where I can fit in. There are many different ways to make money in
            the market in terms of what you can trade (currencies, stocks,
            futures, etc.) and how you trade it (time frames, strategy, etc.).
            As for me, I became intrigued with learning to trade short-term
            momentum stocks.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watching my trading
            mentor make thousands of dollars 30 minutes after market open
            instantly piqued my interest. He made it look so easy, but I soon
            found out that trading is extremely hard and exausting. Even after
            learning several strategies, my first couple months of trading were
            an emotional rollercoaster. Little did I know that all the trading
            knowledge in the world couldn't save me from the lonely, silent
            struggle of being a beginner trader. Having a strategy and a plan
            for every trade is important, but your ability to execute is
            paramount. Trade execution is heavily influenced by trader
            psychology. For example, when you are in a losing trade, it can be
            quite tempting to stay in and hope things turn around, which can
            lead to a monstrous loss.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Statistically, 90&#37; of new traders &apos;blow up&apos;, or lose
            all of the money in their account, and I believe this is mainly due
            to their psychology and not properly managing risk. There were so
            many times where I wanted to give up, but I kept reminding myself
            that winners never quit. Today, I like to think that I've got a
            pretty good handle on trading. Fun fact: I actually became
            interested in learning how to program because I want to automate my
            trading systems. Then, I fell in love with programming and now I
            want to make a career out of it.
